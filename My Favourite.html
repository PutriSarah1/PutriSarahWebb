<h2><p><center><font face="Bell Italic"><font color="E924B9"> This is one of my pet peeves. My favorite cat, 
I have defended him for 4 years. I love him so much, he is a very cuddly cat. His name is Mochi.
The fur is very fine and soft. Although my father does not like to defend the cat but I take good care 
of it and it is always in a good and clean condition. I am a cat lover. I wish I could keep it longer🥺🥰

<h5><p><center><font face="Bradley Hand"><font color="734493"> My favourite food is buttermilk chicken.
 Why do I like it? This is because the creamy and buttery taste goes well with chicken and is 
very addictive. Actually, all dishes with chicken are my favorite, but this is the most favorite 
among them all.
